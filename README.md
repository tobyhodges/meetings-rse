# How to Run a Meeting, for dRTPs
A lesson for digital Research Technical Professionals who participate in and/or lead meetings and frequently feel frustrated when they do so.
The lesson will teach them how to prepare for meetings, how to facilitate an inclusive, efficient, and relevant discussion during them, and how to ensure that the important decisions and actions are recorded and acted on afterwards.

The rendered lesson website is currently available at <https://tobyhodges.github.io/meetings-rse/> but that URL will probably change soon...
