## Introduction

Everyone has been in a meeting that runs too long, is disorganised, has someone who talks too much, or has other pain points. Some of these challenges can be reduced by planning before the meeting but occasionally action will need to be taken directly during the meeting, e.g. interrupting the persistent talker, making people aware of the time left in the session, and implementing processes to reduce the likelihood of it happening again. 

## Identifying Disruptive Behaviours

<!-- Based on https://coast.noaa.gov/ddb/ 
 some attributes have been merged, to focus on their common behaviours?-->

The goal of a facilitator chairing a meeting is to complete the agenda within the assigned timeframe, giving each attendee a chance to contribute to the decisions being made.

It's easy for certain behaviours to work against this, by slowing down the meeting or suppressing voices. Therefore, it's important that the chair can identify these disruptors to prevent them negatively affecting the meeting.

### Overly Negative

<!-- Complaining, Indecisive, Argumentative -->
Overly negative participants may frequently complain or argue, in pursuit of perfection or simply personal attention. This has the effect of reducing the optimism of other participants, and slowing down progress.

### Overly Positive

<!-- Eager -->
Overly positive participants may be too agreeable, leading to overcommitments without critical assessment of viability. This can lead to under delivery or increased team stress when deliverables are due.

### Dominating Conversation

<!-- Talkative, Dominating, Arrogant -->
Some participants love to speak, they may have strong ideas or simply believe their experience/tenure gives them a larger platform. This may lead to rambling, and reduce the ability for all participants to feel comfortable contributing their own ideas.

### Diverting Conversation
<!-- Diverting -->

Some participants frequently attempt to divert the conversation, this may be an attempt to stay light-hearted during stressful meeting or simply disinterest in the topic. This may lead to the meeting running over time, or agenda items not being completed.

<!-- Not covered: Shy, Apathetic -->

## Handling disruptive behaviour

Dealing with disruptions can be slightly scary, but the other meeting participants rely on you, as the chair, to bring the meeting back on track. Most of the times this can be done in a gentle, non-confrontational manner. This can be done as a two-step intervention:

- First, interrupt, if necessary, and state your observation of what is happening. E.g. "We are getting a bit of track here and are no longer talking about our objective."
- Second, suggest a constructive way forward. E.g. "Let us refocus, the question we were discussing was... Who can suggest a solution here?"

However, if this is not successful, it might be necessary to be firmer in calling out the disruption. Address the disrupting person by name, and tell them what to do or stop doing. For example, "Tina, please refrain from using dismissive language when talking about your colleagues work."

:::::: keypoints

* Set explicit expectations and be ready to intervene gently then forcefully if disruptive behaviours recur.
* Invite and make space for contributions from meeting participants.
* Reinforce and attribute the contributions of marginalised individuals.
