:::::: objectives

At the end of this episode, learners will be able to...

* intervene and provide feedback to remedy disruptive behaviours.
* create contribution opportunities for all participants during a meeting.

## Introduction

Everyone has been in a meeting that runs too long, is disorganised, has someone who talks too much, or has other pain points. Some of these challenges can be reduced by planning before the meeting but occasionally action will need to be taken directly during the meeting, e.g. interrupting the persistent talker, making people aware of the time left in the session, and implementing processes to reduce the likelihood of it happening again. 

# Handling disruptive behaviour

Dealing with disruptions can be slightly scary, but the other meeting participants rely on you, as the chair, to bring the meeting back on track. Most of the times this can be done in a gentle, non-confrontational manner. This can be done as a two-step intervention:

- First, interrupt, if necessary, and state your observation of what is happening. E.g. "We are getting a bit of track here and are no longer talking about our objective."
- Second, suggest a constructive way forward. E.g. "Let us refocus, the question we were discussing was... Who can suggest a solution here?"

However, if this is not successful, it might be necessary to be firmer in calling out the disruption. Address the disrupting person by name, and tell them what to do or stop doing. For example, "Tina, please refrain from using dismissive language when talking about your colleagues work."

### Exercise: What did we learn?

Thinking about the exercise: What went well? What was hard? Interrupting when a meeting isn't "going right" isn't easy, but it doesn't have to be hard. Some points to remember: 

- Address disruptions in two ways.
  - At the time the disruption happens, make sure the behaviour is stopped.
  - _After_ the meeting, make sure that you look at systemic ways to reduce that type of disruption as well - e.g. if you always run over time, consider assigning a standard "timekeeper" role to every meeting.
- Practice can make it easier to interrupt, but **be aware of power dynamics**: it's one thing to stop a disagreement when you're chairing a meeting, but it might (or might not) be wise to interrupt someone who is in a much "higher" position in a hierarchy, if they aren't receptive to feedback.
- If you _do_ have power or privilege (e.g. you're a chair, or you're a member of an in-group), make sure to use that power and privelege to support marginalised members. Sometimes it could be as simple as repeating what another person said and attributing it to the original speaker.

:::::: keypoints

* Set explicit expectations and be ready to intervene gently then forcefully if disruptive behaviours recur.
* Invite and make space for contributions from meeting participants.
* Reinforce and attribute the contributions of marginalised individuals.
