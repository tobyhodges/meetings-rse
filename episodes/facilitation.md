## Introduction

Everyone has been in a meeting that runs too long, is disorganised, has someone who talks too much, or has other pain points. Some of these challenges can be reduced by planning before the meeting but occasionally action will need to be taken directly during the meeting, e.g. interrupting the persistent talker, making people aware of the time left in the session, and implementing processes to reduce the likelihood of it happening again. 

:::::: keypoints

* Set explicit expectations and be ready to intervene gently then forcefully if disruptive behaviours recur.
* Invite and make space for contributions from meeting participants.
* Reinforce and attribute the contributions of marginalised individuals.
