## Introduction

This is a lesson created via The Carpentries Workbench. It is written in
[Pandoc-flavored Markdown](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html) for static files and
[R Markdown][r-markdown] for dynamic files that can render code into output. 
Please refer to the [Introduction to The Carpentries 
Workbench](https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper-docs/) for full documentation.

What you need to know is that there are three sections required for a valid
Carpentries lesson:

 1. `questions` are displayed at the beginning of the episode to prime the
    learner for the content.
 2. `objectives` are the learning objectives for an episode displayed with
    the questions.
 3. `keypoints` are displayed at the end of the episode to reinforce the
    objectives.

## Our First Exercise (10 minutes)

Think of an example of a bad meeting you attended.
What did you find was making you not want to attend more meetings like it? 
Why did it make such an impression on you?
Try to differentiate between **what was bad about the behavior** of the chair and attendees
and **what was good about the setup** of the meeting.
Take a few minutes to write down some notes about your answer,
then introduce yourself to the other participants and tell them about it.
