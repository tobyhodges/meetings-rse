# Handling disruptive behaviour

Dealing with disruptions can be slightly scary, but the other meeting participants rely on you, as the chair, to bring the meeting back on track. Most of the times this can be done in a gentle, non-confrontational manner. This can be done as a two-step intervention:

- First, interrupt, if necessary, and state your observation of what is happening. E.g. "We are getting a bit of track here and are no longer talking about our objective."
- Second, suggest a constructive way forward. E.g. "Let us refocus, the question we were discussing was... Who can suggest a solution here?"

However, if this is not successful, it might be necessary to be firmer in calling out the disruption. Address the disrupting person by name, and tell them what to do or stop doing. For example, "Tina, please refrain from using dismissive language when talking about your colleagues work."

:::::: keypoints

* Set explicit expectations and be ready to intervene gently then forcefully if disruptive behaviours recur.
* Invite and make space for contributions from meeting participants.
* Reinforce and attribute the contributions of marginalised individuals.
